What is Prog-2000
-----------------
I've created this github page for "Intro to Micro and C Programming" in hopes of teaching my self how to use github while learning C; also to help fellow students. You can find the <a href="https://github.com/glennlopez/Prog-2000/wiki">Answers to Package Questions here</a>. Practice Midterm Exam will be provided by asking me via email (Free). I don't give out answers, make a group, work together, and find the solution. 

If you're wondering where all this is going to (the stuff you're learning in Prog-200) its to get you ready for this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXBk6Y79Lrg |

Students planning on taking Electronics Engineering Technology
-----------------
Depending on when you finish this course, I highly recommend adding C++ http://www.learncpp.com/ to your skillset to set you apart from the other 200+ students looking for co-op. Never believe anyone that tells you how C is exactly just like C++ or vice versa. These people have either never written in an Object Oriented Programming mindset before, have no useful experience writing code in C++, or just rehashing what they heard from "experts" born in the 70's. 

C++ provides you the option between procedural, object-oriented, and generative programming. This means you can address your problems in several diffrent ways. In C++, you can manage you stack and heap memory better, get the job done faster with fewer lines of code and have access to constructs like operator overloading, classes, and lambda expressions. Knowing both means you'll be a better investment to your employer later on. It gives you an opportunity to get promoted from within and take on Engineering roles.
