What is Prog-2000
-----------------
I've created this github page for "Intro to Micro and C Programming" in hopes of teaching my self how to use github while learning C; also to help fellow students. You can find the <a href="https://github.com/glennlopez/Prog-2000/wiki">Answers to Package Questions here</a>, practice Midterm Exam provided <a href="https://github.com/glennlopez/Prog-2000/wiki/Practice-Midterm-Exam">here</a>, and finished labs <a href="https://github.com/glennlopez/Prog-2000/tree/master/FINISHED%20LAB"> here</a>. I don't give out answers to exams, make a group, work together, and find the solution. 

It's your choice to use these resources I am providing as reference or for cheating. Maybe when learning is not commensurately represented by grades, you'll realize how pointless it is to say you learned something, when you clearly havn't. If you are going to cheat, atleast be creative about it. Keep in mind that grades are only a currency and sole commodity of schools. In real life, your grades are worthless. Sometimes you have to find ways to cheat the system, and people who blindly follow the rules are the same sets of people who don't think for themselfs-- these are the people who will fail to inovate and make a difference in the company they are working for. These are the people who belong in government jobs with uninions that protect the weak.. the ones too lazy to make a diffrence in society.


If you're wondering where all this is going to (the stuff you're learning in Prog-200) its to get you ready for this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXBk6Y79Lrg
