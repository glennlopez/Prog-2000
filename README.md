What is Prog-2000
-----------------

I've created this github page for "Intro to Micro and C Programming" in hopes of teaching my self how to use github while learning C. It's also a reward for resourceful students. In engineering, it's a lot more benificial to be resourceful than to be "smart". As you'll quickly learn in your career, life is a giant sandbox. It's doesn't have the same constrains that college has. In real life <b>YOU ARE ALLOWED</b> to cheat (reverse engineer competitor products and rebrand it as your own). 

You can find the <a href="https://github.com/glennlopez/Prog-2000/wiki">Answers to Package Questions here</a>. "Practice" Midterm Exam will be provided by asking me in person (Midterm exams are taken from multiple sources - I do not personally give you the exam copy, I just forward you to sources I trust who has them).
