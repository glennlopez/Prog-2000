What is Prog-2000
-----------------
I've created this github page for "Intro to Micro and C Programming" to fill a missing aspect in RRC's primative course design (colaborative software coding). It's also to help fellow students. I will provide you old exams and labs. It was 2012 when this was created.. if by 4 years you are still given the same exam and labs, then I HIGHLY suggest you find a diffrent school if you care about making a diffrence in technology. If you just took this course to get a diploma and dont really give a shit about the subject you are studying, then you came to the right college. Congratulations, here are your <a href="https://github.com/glennlopez/Prog-2000/wiki">Answers to Package Questions</a>. Bewarned, if you go down this path I GUARANTEE you won't understand anything by 3rd year and most likley fail (possibly not understand why you dont understand anything)... tred carefuly

"Practice" Midterm Exam will be provided by asking me via email (gives me a general idea for its demand). I don't give out answers to midterms. If you want the answers to the exams then make a group, work together, and find the solution - teamwork is everything when building software -- don't be the lonely nerd that does everything on his own. Inovation comes from a multiplicity of derived ideas coming from diverse mindsets, colaborated together to solve a unique problem. 

If you're not solving a unique problem then you're just copy-paste engineering.
